# street-art-app-public

Street Art App is an application which encourages people to find, enjoy and document street art. This application is similar in style and function to existing photo sharing apps, but it is solely for street art. Users of this application can 1) view street art in a scrolling view from newest to oldest posts 2) find street art near them using the map view and 3) "bookmark" and "like" street art that they have seen or would like to see.

I am working on this project with a friend who came up with the ispiration and structure for this project. He has built the backend services with Cloud Firestore, integrated Cordova, created geolocation and map functionality, and has written the more complex logic within Vue.js, in additon to many other things.

I have personally contributed to the following components of this app: main.js, router.js, app-store.js, user-store.js, ArtworkDetail.vue, ArtworkMap.vue, UserContent.vue, ArtworkGlobal.vue, ArtworkListTile.vue, ArtworkDetailCard.vue, ArtworkDetailMap.vue, BookmarksListTile.vue, UserBookmarks.vue, UserLikes.vue, UserPhotoTile.vue & UserPhotos.vue
